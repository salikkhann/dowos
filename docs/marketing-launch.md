## 3. Pre-beta: Instagram teaser sequence (Mar 7–13)

Stories only — no feed posts yet. Build curiosity without revealing the product.

| Date | Story content | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Mar 7 | "Something big is coming for Dow students 🎓" | Plant the seed |
| Mar 9 | Screenshot of AMBOSS / UWorld pricing in USD. Caption: "This is what medical students in Pakistan are paying." | Establish the pain point + competitor pricing |
| Mar 11 | Blurred app UI. Caption: "Not for long." | Tease the product exists |
| Mar 12 | 3-second AI Tutor clip (no voiceover, just the screen). Caption: "AI that actually knows your curriculum." | Show the wow factor |
| Mar 13 | "Tomorrow. 🗓️" | Final hook before beta |

**WhatsApp seed (Mar 13):** Drop a line to 1-2 trusted contacts already in major Dow student groups — not a blast, just: *"heads up, something dropping tomorrow for Dow students — keep an eye out"*. Word travels fast in group chats.

### 5.2 LinkedIn post — structure + talking points

This is **your** post — write it in your own voice.  Here is the skeleton and the points to hit.  Every section maps to one of the three angles you want (founder story, thought leadership, B2B pitch).

---

**HOOK (first line — everything before "see more"):**

> "I spent 3 months building something that might change how medical students in Pakistan learn."

---

**SECTION 1 — The problem** *(founder story angle)*

- International ed-tech apps charge $150–300 / year.
- They're built for Harvard and Oxford curricula.
- Pakistani medical students pay the same price for a fraction of the value.
- No single app combines timetable + attendance + AI + MCQ + campus life.
- I saw this gap every day.  So I built the answer.

**SECTION 2 — What we built** *(product angle)*

- DowOS — a medical student super-app built from the ground up for Dow Medical College, Karachi.
- AI Tutor powered by Google Gemini, backed by actual textbook content (not hallucinations).
- MCQ Solver with AMBOSS-style drill filters: All / Incorrects / Undone.
- Viva Bot for mock exam practice with adaptive scoring.
- Timetable, attendance, campus maps, Lost & Found — all in one place.
- The free tier is genuinely useful.  Pro is PKR 3 000 / year — less than one month of AMBOSS in USD.

**SECTION 3 — The bigger picture** *(thought leadership + B2B angle)*

- This isn't just about Dow.
- The government-sector university experience in Pakistan is due for an overhaul.  DowOS is proof it's possible.
- If you are a vice chancellor, department head, or anyone with the ability to transform your university's digital infrastructure — reach out.  We can deploy DowOS for your institution.
- Ed-tech in Pakistan doesn't have to lag behind the world.  It can lead.

**CLOSING (1–2 lines + engagement hook):**

> "We're changing the future of ed-tech in Pakistan.  One university at a time."
>
> "What's the biggest gap in your university's digital experience?"  ← drives comments

---

**LinkedIn format rules (algorithm):**

- **No links in the post body.** Put the DowOS link in the **first comment** immediately after publishing.
- Use a blank line between every 1–2 sentences.  White space = readability = dwell time.
- Tag 2–3 people **max** — only if genuinely relevant (e.g. a Dow faculty member, a co-builder, someone at a Pakistani university).
- Post between **7–9 AM or 12 PM PKT**.  First-hour engagement is what the algorithm rewards.

## 7. Beta assets to collect (Mar 14–27)

Before full launch you need proof.  Collect these during the beta window:

- [ ] **2–3 student quotes** — even informal ones work ("this saved me 2 hours", "the AI actually answered my question correctly")
- [ ] **Screen recordings** — AI Tutor answering a question live, MCQ drill, timetable check-in
- [ ] **Beta stats** — total questions answered, MCQs attempted, active users, sessions completed
- [ ] **1 "before / after" anecdote** — a tester who studied differently because of DowOS

These feed into the full-launch Reel (§5.1) and the LinkedIn post (§5.2 Section 2).
