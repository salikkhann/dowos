## 1. Team & ownership

Salik and Ammaar co-lead all marketing. Every piece of content goes through both before it goes live.

| Role | Owner | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy + scripts | Salik + Ammaar | Hook copy, Reel scripts, carousel outlines, posting schedule |
| Screen recordings | Salik | All app demos — export as MP4 at 1080 p |
| Reel filming + editing | Ammaar | Camera work, cuts, text overlays, music |
| Carousel design | Ammaar | Canva templates. Navy background, Teal accents. Match design system exactly. |
| Posting + scheduling | Ammaar | Buffer or native Instagram scheduler. Follow the calendar in §7 exactly. |
| WhatsApp blasts | Ammaar | Direct access to Dow student group admins |
| LinkedIn | Salik | Founder story — written in Salik's own voice |
| Beta feedback collection | Both | Quotes, screenshots, stats during Mar 14–27. See §10. |
| Logo creation | Both | Ammaar leads design, Salik reviews. See §2 brief. Done by Mar 6. |

## 2. Logo brief

### 2.1 Brand context

DowOS = "Dow" (the university) + "OS" (operating system). The logo needs to feel modern, trustworthy, and slightly techy — but not cold. It's an app for medical students, so warmth matters.

### 2.2 Colour palette (locked — use exactly these)

| Colour | Hex | Role in logo |
|---|---|---|
| Navy | #1A2B4C | Primary logo body. Wordmark text. Icon fills. |
| Teal | #00A896 | Accent stroke, glow, or highlight element. The "life" in the mark. |
| Gold | #D4A574 | Pro badge only. Do NOT put in the main logo mark. |
| Offwhite | #F5F5F7 | Background for light-mode versions. Logo must read cleanly on this. |
| Dark BG | #0F1823 | Background for dark-mode versions. Logo must read cleanly on this too. |

### 2.3 Typography

- **Wordmark font:** Outfit Bold (weight 800). This is already the DowOS heading font — using it in the wordmark makes the logo and app feel like one system.
- **Letter spacing:** −0.02 em (tight, matches the design system H1 rule).
- **Colour split:** "Dow" in Navy, "OS" in Teal. This two-tone split says "university + tech" in one glance.

### 2.4 Three logo concepts — pick one, refine it

**Concept A — "D" monogram ← recommended**
A single stylised capital D. The vertical stroke is solid Navy. The curved stroke fades into Teal. No extra decoration — just clean geometry. Works at any size down to 16×16 px favicon. Best for the app icon.

**Concept B — Stethoscope "O"**
The letter O in "DowOS" is replaced by the loop of a stethoscope. The tube curves out and back in Teal. Rest of the wordmark is Navy. More personality, slightly more complex — test it at 32×32 px before committing. Better as a horizontal lockup than as a standalone icon.

**Concept C — Pulse line underline**
A flat ECG pulse line runs under the wordmark as an underline. Starts in Navy, peaks in Teal at the centre, flattens back to Navy. Simple and medical without being cliché. Works best as a horizontal lockup for Reels and banners.

### 2.5 Deliverables needed

| Asset | Size | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| App icon | 1024 × 1024 px | PNG, transparent BG | Single mark only (Concept A monogram ideal). No wordmark — too small at this use. |
| Social avatar | 400 × 400 px | PNG | Same mark as app icon. |
| Horizontal lockup | 1200 × 400 px | PNG + SVG | Mark + wordmark side by side. Used in Reels, banners, LinkedIn header. |
| Dark-mode variant | Same sizes as above | PNG | Swap Navy elements to Offwhite so it reads on #0F1823 background. |
| Favicon | 32 × 32 px | ICO / SVG | Simplified version of the mark — single stroke, no detail. |

### 2.6 How to create it

1. **Canva** — fastest. Start from a blank 1024×1024 canvas. Outfit font is available in Canva. Draw shapes manually or use the logo builder. Export as PNG.
2. **Figma** — more control over spacing and SVG export. Same creative process.
3. **If stuck** — post a quick brief on Fiverr (budget PKR 2 000–5 000). Turnaround 2–3 days. Give them this §2 as the full spec.

**Target:** Logo done by **Mar 6** — one day before teasers start. It appears in the beta Reel (§6.1) and every feature post from Mar 15 onward.

## 5. Pre-beta: Instagram teaser sequence (Mar 7–13)

Stories only — no feed posts yet. Build curiosity without revealing the product.

| Date | Story content | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Mar 7 | "Something big is coming for Dow students 🎓" | Plant the seed |
| Mar 9 | Screenshot of AMBOSS / UWorld pricing in USD. Caption: "This is what medical students in Pakistan are paying." | Establish the pain point — international pricing |
| Mar 10 | Screenshot: a past-paper app. Price tag visible: "PKR 5 000 / year". Caption: "And the local options aren't much better." | Hit the local alternative — same price bracket, one feature, no polish |
| Mar 11 | Blurred app UI. Caption: "Not for long." | Tease the product exists |
| Mar 12 | 3-second AI Tutor clip (no voiceover, just the screen). Caption: "AI that actually knows your curriculum." | Show the wow factor |
| Mar 13 | "Tomorrow. 🗓️" | Final hook before beta |

**WhatsApp seed (Mar 13):** Drop a line to 1–2 trusted contacts already in major Dow student groups — not a blast, just: *"heads up, something dropping tomorrow for Dow students — keep an eye out"*. Word travels fast in group chats.

### 8.2 LinkedIn post — structure + talking points

This is **Salik's** post — write it in your own voice.  Here is the skeleton and the points to hit.  Every section maps to one of the three angles (founder story, thought leadership, B2B pitch).

---

**HOOK (first line — everything before "see more"):**

> "I spent 3 months building something that might change how medical students in Pakistan learn."

---

**SECTION 1 — The problem** *(founder story)*

- International ed-tech apps charge $150–300 / year.
- They're built for Harvard and Oxford curricula.
- Pakistani medical students pay the same price for a fraction of the value.
- The local alternatives? One feature — past papers. PKR 5 000 a year. And the interface crashes.
- No single app combines timetable + attendance + AI + MCQ + campus life.
- I saw this gap every day.  So I built the answer.

**SECTION 2 — What we built** *(product)*

- DowOS — a medical student super-app built from the ground up for Dow Medical College, Karachi.
- AI Tutor powered by Google Gemini, backed by actual textbook content.
- MCQ Solver with AMBOSS-style drill filters: All / Incorrects / Undone.
- Viva Bot for mock exam practice with adaptive scoring.
- Timetable, attendance, campus maps, Lost & Found, Prayer Times — all in one place.
- The free tier is genuinely useful.  Pro is PKR 3 000 / year — less than one month of AMBOSS in USD.

**SECTION 3 — The bigger picture** *(thought leadership + B2B)*

- This isn't just about Dow.
- The government-sector university experience in Pakistan is due for an overhaul.  DowOS is proof it's possible.
- If you are a vice chancellor, department head, or anyone with the ability to transform your university's digital infrastructure — reach out.  We can deploy DowOS at your institution.
- Ed-tech in Pakistan doesn't have to lag behind the world.  It can lead.

**CLOSING:**

> "We're changing the future of ed-tech in Pakistan.  One university at a time."
>
> "What's the biggest gap in your university's digital experience?"  ← drives comments

---

**LinkedIn format rules (algorithm):**

- **No links in the post body.** Put the DowOS link in the **first comment** immediately after publishing.
- Blank line between every 1–2 sentences.  White space = readability = dwell time.
- Tag 2–3 people **max** — only if genuinely relevant (e.g. a Dow faculty member, a co-builder, someone at a Pakistani university).
- Post between **7–9 AM or 12 PM PKT**.  First-hour engagement is what the algorithm rewards.

---

## 10. Beta assets to collect (Mar 14–27)

Before full launch you need proof.  Collect these during the beta window:

- [ ] **2–3 student quotes** — even informal ones work ("this saved me 2 hours", "the AI actually answered my question correctly")
- [ ] **Screen recordings** — AI Tutor answering a question live, MCQ drill in action, timetable check-in
- [ ] **Beta stats** — total questions answered, MCQs attempted, active users, sessions completed
- [ ] **1 "before / after" anecdote** — a tester who studied differently because of DowOS

These feed into the full-launch Reel (§8.1) and the LinkedIn post (§8.2 Section 2).
