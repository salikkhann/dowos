# Session 2 – 2026-02-04

## Project state at start of session

- Next.js 15 scaffold fully created: 13 route pages across `(app)/` and `(auth)/` groups, 8 shadcn/ui components, Tailwind v4, Zustand, TanStack Query — all installed and compiled.
- `/docs` populated with 7 files: PRD (overview + complete), database schema (35+ tables), design system, UX/UI guidelines, locked decisions, discovery doc.
- Git: local repo on `master`, 2 commits, no remote.
- Supabase: client packages installed (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`), `.env.local.example` present, but no `.env.local` with real keys.
- GitHub: repo not yet created.

## What we did today

1. **Audited full project state** — read all `/docs` files, verified scaffold structure, confirmed what was and wasn't done in session 1.
2. **Created `CLAUDE.md`** — project guide covering role/facts, must-follow rules (including mandatory session logging), tech stack, folder structure, Supabase/Gemini patterns, and workflow/safety conventions. Committed to `main`.
3. **Connected Supabase** — created `.env.local` with real project URL + anon key + service-role key. Verified connection (REST endpoint returned 200 with schema). File is gitignored.
4. **Connected GitHub** — created repo `salikkhann/dowos`, renamed local branch `master` → `main`, added remote origin, pushed all 3 commits. `main` now tracks `origin/main`.
5. **Created this session doc** and the roadmap + todo files (see below).

## Decisions made

- Branch `master` renamed to `main` to match configured PR target.
- CLAUDE.md rule #11 / Workflow #8: session doc updates are mandatory at end of every session.

## Next immediate steps

1. Create `src/lib/supabase.ts` — wire up `createBrowserClient` / `createServerClient` using env vars.
2. Create the first Supabase migration: `users` + `user_preferences` tables (the auth-gate tables everything else depends on).
3. Build the Auth flow: signup (email → OTP → profile → ID photo upload) + login + middleware route guard.
4. Stand up the dashboard shell with bottom-nav (mobile) / sidebar (desktop).
5. Kick off the 45-day roadmap (see `docs/roadmap-day-by-day.md`).
