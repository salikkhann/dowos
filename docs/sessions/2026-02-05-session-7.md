# Session 7 — Model usage guide + tech stack audit

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Picks up from:** Session 6 (pricing, Progress Matrix, cursor-pro-strategy)

---

## What happened this session

### 1. Model usage guide (`docs/model-usage-guide.md`)
- Created detailed guide for Claude Code Pro + Cursor Pro usage
- Task-by-task recommendations: Opus vs Sonnet per task type
- Daily workflow to maximize output (morning Opus, midday Sonnet, afternoon Claude Code)
- Prompt efficiency tips, capacity limits reference
- MVP timeline feasibility: 10–15 days (15 realistic, 10 aggressive)
- Escalation rules: when to switch Sonnet → Opus

### 2. Tech stack audit (`docs/tech-stack-audit.md`)
- Deep audit of full stack: Next.js, Supabase, AI (Gemini/DeepSeek), voice (Groq/Google TTS), maps (MapLibre), auth, payments, mobile (Capacitor), styling
- Verdict: **stack is the best possible way to build DowOS** for 3-person team, 2K users, PKR 2.25M Y1 target
- Strengths: single backend, cost-optimized AI tiering, Pakistan-aware choices
- Risks documented: content dependency, manual payment ops
- Missing dependencies listed: Sentry, adhan, hijri-converter, Capacitor, MapLibre, groq, Google TTS, Gemini SDK, sonner

## Files created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/model-usage-guide.md` | Which model for which task; daily workflow; MVP timeline |
| `docs/tech-stack-audit.md` | Full stack audit; verdict: proceed as locked |

## State of the project

- Model usage and tech stack documented. Ready for Phase 2 build.
- User confirmed: Cursor + Claude Code, 20–40 prompts/day target, 10–15 day MVP feasible if max output.

## What comes next

- Phase 2A: Install Sentry, Resend, adhan, hijri-converter
- NavShell first (BottomNav + Sidebar)
- Follow `docs/model-usage-guide.md` for Opus vs Sonnet per task
