## What happened

Resumed from a context summary. Three workstreams completed in one session:

### 5a — Retry failed edits (7 edits)

A previous parallel batch had 5 of 7 edits fail due to a "File has not been read
yet" cascading error (admin-content-upload.md had lost read-state after
compaction). All 7 edits retried and succeeded:

- `admin-content-upload.md` — §2.3 text extraction model named as Gemini 2.5 Pro
  via Files API. Viva sheet note + quick-ref table: "Anki mode" → "Browse Q&A" (2
  edits).
- `.cursorrules` — nav config: Anki Mode → Browse Q&A at `/education/viva/browse`.
- `docs/windsurf-rules.md` — same nav config change.
- `docs/decisions/ui-page-structure.md` — sidebar annotation + route tree: `anki/`
  → `browse/`.

### 5b — Education tab major rewrite (10 edits to education-tab.md)

User clarified: *"there is no anki mode. it just either you have a viva bot
asking you stuff, or you can see the questions and answers."* Also: saved
questions is Phase 1, flashcards (actual spaced-rep) is Phase 2, and MCQ needs
AMBOSS-style drill filters + analytics.

Changes applied:

| Section | What changed |
|---|---|
| §2 Feature table | Removed "Viva Bot + Anki Mode" row. Added separate rows: Viva Bot (Pro), Browse Q&A (Free), Saved Questions (Phase 1). MCQ row gets analytics + filters note. Flashcards stays Phase 2. |
| §3 Phase 1 cards | Viva card: "[📖 Anki Mode →]" → "[Browse Q&A →]". New Saved Questions card added (badge shows count). |
| §3 Phase 2 cards | Saved Questions card removed (moved to Phase 1). |
| §4 Route tree | `anki/` → `browse/`. `saved/` label changed from Phase 2 to Phase 1. |
| §4.1 Mode picker | "Anki Mode" → "Browse Q&A" in intro line, mode picker card, and if/else branch. |
| §4.2 (full rewrite) | "Anki Mode — self-study flashcards" section replaced with "Browse Q&A — see questions and answers". New wireframes: collapsed list → tap to expand → answer + key points + Save button. Comparison table updated. "Why both exist" rewritten. |
| §5.4 (new section) | Drill-entry analytics + filter screen added after §5.3. Stats bar (% correct, streak). Three filter pills: All / Incorrects / Undone. Save bookmark icon on every drill question. |
| §7 Timeline | Days 17–23 table updated: Day 17 cards list includes Saved Questions; Day 18-19 adds stats + filters + save; Day 20 adds Saved Questions page; Day 22 is Browse Q&A (not Anki). |

### 5c — PDF extraction model locked

Two edits to `rag-architecture.md` (applied in the previous batch, committed
this session):
- §4.2 chunking strategy table: `pdf.js` → `Gemini 2.5 Pro (native PDF ingestion
  via Files API)`.
- §6 ingestion pipeline diagram: same change.

**Rationale:** Gemini 2.5 Pro via Files API is native PDF (no OCR preprocessing),
already in the vendor stack, 2 M token context window, and benchmarks best on
medical textbook layouts (dense tables, multi-column, diagrams with labels).
Mistral OCR 3 is strong standalone but adds a vendor; Google Document AI caps at
~96 % on printed text. Gemini wins on multimodal understanding at zero new
dependencies.

### 5d — Marketing launch plan

User asked for a marketing document covering Instagram, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp
groups. Four questions asked and answered:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Launch date | Beta Mar 14, full launch late March (locked as Mar 28) |
| Tone | Professional |
| Instagram hook | Pain point + competitor pricing ("charging way too much for no substance") |
| LinkedIn angle | Founder story + thought leadership (ed-tech Pakistan) + product + B2B pitch (deploy DowOS at other universities). Changing the government-sector university experience. |

`docs/marketing-launch.md` written. Covers:
- Full timeline (teasers Mar 7–13, beta Mar 14, full launch Mar 28)
- Pre-beta Instagram Stories teaser sequence (5 posts)
- Beta Reel script (30 s, pain-point → reveal → pricing contrast → CTA)
- Full-launch Reel script (30 s, beta proof → tour → open → vision)
- LinkedIn post outline: hook + 3-section structure (problem, product, vision/B2B)
  + format rules (no links in body, line breaks, posting time)
- WhatsApp messages for both beta and full launch
- Post-launch action checklist
- Beta asset collection checklist (quotes, recordings, stats)

Skills used: `launch-strategy` (ORB framework, five-phase approach),
`social-content` (platform-specific format rules, hook formulas).

### 5e — Roadmap restructured

Phase 6 compressed from 6 days to 3 (critical QA only). Phase 7 = Beta Launch
(Mar 14). Phase 8 = Beta Feedback & Iteration (Mar 15–27). Phase 9 = Full Launch
(Mar 28). Deferrable QA items moved to Phase 8.
