## Work Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Todo Expansion
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- Expanded `docs/todo-current.md` from ~80 lines to 734+ lines
- Cross-referenced all 17 decision docs, PRD, roadmap, and marketing plan to identify missing tasks
- Added complete coverage for Phases 1-14 + parallel workstreams:
  - Phase 3: AI & Learning Core (RAG pipeline, MCQ Solver, AI Tutor, Voice Mode)
  - Phase 4: Viva Bot, Browse Q&A, Study Tracker (expanded)
  - Phase 5: Community, Prayers, Maps (detailed)
  - Phase 6: Dow Credits & Pro Subscription (separated from each other)
  - Phase 7: Capacitor Build + Push Notifications + QA (moved here from Phase 2)
  - Phase 8-10: Beta Launch, Feedback, Full Launch
  - Phase 11: Revenue Features (DowEats, Merch, Marketplace — detailed subtasks)
  - Phase 12: Education Phase 2 (Flashcards SM-2, Quick Summaries, Exam Prediction Engine, Study Guides)
  - Phase 13: Scale & Growth (Android Polish, iOS, Bus GPS, Notification Center, AI Study Buddy Nudges, Mental Health, B2B)
  - Phase 14: Continuous Improvement (Performance, Content, Legal, Financial)
  - Parallel Workstreams: Azfar (content), Marketing, Ammaar (maps + ops), Salik (dev)

### 2. Pro Subscription Flow Fix
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- User corrected: Pro upgrade is NOT through Dow Credits
- Rewrote Phase 6B: Pro subscription uses separate Easypaisa/JazzCash direct payment with receipt verification
- Dow Credits are only for DowEats/Merch/Marketplace transactions

### 3. Decision Documents Created
- **Status:** COMPLETE (both LOCKED)

**`docs/decisions/study-tracker.md`:**
- Renamed "Progress Matrix" to "Study Tracker"
- Combined UX: manual subtopic checklist (from Salik's existing batch tracker) + auto-calculated mastery heatmap
- Two metrics per cell: Coverage % (manual ticks) + Mastery % (MCQ 50% + Viva 30% + Flashcards 20%)
- Subtopic-level drill-down with checkboxes + auto scores + "Drill this topic" CTA
- Batch aggregate view (anonymized, min 5 students per bucket, cached 1 hour)
- Auto-tick suggestions (5+ MCQ attempts at 60%+ accuracy)
- New table: `student_topic_coverage`

**`docs/decisions/study-guides.md`:**
- Three content types: module guides (year-specific), general guides (shared), resource hub (per-module)
- All curated by Azfar/team, not AI-generated
- Standardized sections per guide type
- All free for all users (no Pro gate — conversion funnel via deep links)
- New tables: `study_guides`, `study_resources`
- Build: Week 9 post-launch

### 4. Product Assessment & Strategic Additions
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- Analyzed DowOS strengths: campus-locked super-app, free MCQs, Voice Viva Bot, revenue diversification
- Identified gaps: no gamification, no wellness features, no exam prediction
- Added to todo:
  - **Phase 12C: Exam Prediction Engine** — past paper analysis, frequency matrix, high-yield badges, AI-powered "3-day study plan"
  - **Phase 13: AI Study Buddy Nudges** — streak-at-risk, topic gap, exam proximity, celebration, optimal study time nudges
  - **Phase 13: Mental Health & Wellness** — study break reminders, breathing exercises, wellness check-in, exam anxiety resources, DND study mode

### 5. Phase Reordering
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- Moved Capacitor/Android from Phase 2 (Day 10) to Phase 7 (Days 36-38, pre-beta)
- Moved Push Notifications from Phase 2E to Phase 7B
- Logic: build the entire web app first, wrap in Capacitor only when ready for beta

### 6. Pricing & Expansion Strategy Discussion
- **Status:** COMPLETE (advisory, no code changes)

**Pricing conclusions:**
- PKR 3,000/year is right for launch — low enough to remove price objection, can raise later
- Exam-season pass (PKR 1,500/3mo) is the biggest conversion lever — panic-buy before profs
- Free tier is generous but correct — MCQ/Study Tracker/Flashcards are daily hooks, AI rate limits are the conversion trigger
- No middle tier needed at 2,000 users
- DowEats 15% commission is competitive (Foodpanda charges 25-30%)
- Marketplace 10% is at the ceiling for campus
- Realistic Pro conversion: 15-20% (not 25%)
- Revenue math at 15%: ~PKR 1.2M from Pro + DowEats/Merch/Marketplace fills gap to PKR 2.25M target

**CampusOS expansion conclusions:**
- Feasible: ~170 medical colleges in Pakistan, ~28,000 MBBS seats/year, no competitor
- Don't build for multi-tenant yet — prove model at Dow first
- University #2 via student champion (not cold-pitching admins), revenue-share model
- Stay in medical for first 5-10 colleges before considering engineering/business
- Bootstrap first, raise only when scaling faster than organic growth
- Biggest risks: content dependency per campus, ops dependency (DowEats needs local Ammaar), retention between exam seasons
